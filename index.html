<p>Camels are one of the cutest animals (i'm joking!), so why not make them using paper and make them even cuter?</p>
<a href="https://www.origami.me/chameleon"><img src="images/chameleon.png" width="200" height="200"></a>
<p>Chameleons are one of the STRAGEST animals in the world due to their capability to change their color to match their surroundings so that they can hide from their predators.</p>

<p>I bet many of you guys looking at this app right now don't know about a cicada. Well, let me tell you that they are bugs and they also sleep upside down and one more thing: they are scary and creepy so don't look at any of the google images related to them!</p>

<p>Pandas are REALLY the cutest animals that i have ever seen (and this time i'm not joking!). They have such big and cute eyes!</p>

<p>Pigeons are birds, what other reason to make them?</p>
